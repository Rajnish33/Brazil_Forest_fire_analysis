# Forest Fire Analysis in Brazil – Project Overview
<h1> This project focuses on understanding the patterns, causes, and impacts of forest fires across Brazil, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions like the Amazon and Cerrado. Using satellite data, climate indicators, and historical fire records, the analysis aims to:</h1>
<h2> • 	Identify high-risk zones and seasonal trends</h2>
<h2>• 	Correlate fire outbreaks with human activity and weather conditions</h2>
<h2>• 	Assess environmental damage and carbon emissions</h2>
<h2>• 	Support policy-making and conservation efforts</h2>
<h1>The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for fire prevention, resource allocation, and sustainable land management.</h1>
